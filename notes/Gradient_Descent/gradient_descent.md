# Gradient Descent – Explained Simply

## 📌 Why Gradient Descent Matters

Gradient Descent is one of the **most important optimization algorithms** in both **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

Whether you're training a linear regression model or tuning millions of neural network weights, gradient descent is the technique that helps your model **learn by minimizing error**.

## 🧠 Intuition

Imagine you're on a mountain at night with only a flashlight—you want to reach the lowest point (minimum). At every step, you check which direction slopes down the most and take a step in that direction. That’s gradient descent!

---

## 🧮 The Math (in Simple Terms)

To minimize a function (like loss/error), we use the gradient (slope) to move in the opposite direction:

```math
\theta := \theta - \alpha \cdot \nabla J(\theta)
```

Where:

* `\theta` is your parameter (weight)
* `\alpha` is the learning rate
* `J(\theta)` is the cost/loss function
* `\nabla J(\theta)` is the derivative (gradient)

## 📉 Convex vs Non-Convex

* **Convex functions** (e.g., linear regression loss) have one global minimum — gradient descent works well
* **Non-convex functions** (e.g., deep networks) have many local minima/saddles — gradient descent still works, but may not find the best minimum

## ⚙️ Types of Gradient Descent

| Type                 | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch**            | Uses all training data per update — stable but slow       |
| **Stochastic (SGD)** | Uses 1 random data point per update — noisy but faster    |
| **Mini-batch**       | Uses a small batch of data — balances speed and stability |
